<p>
Apache BSF3 - an implementation of JSR-223 (javax.script).
<pre>
*----------------------------------------------------------------------*
* BSF3 was developed according to the JSR-223 specs, but has not yet   *
* been tested via the JSR-223 TCK. BSF can therefore not be considered *
* a compatible implementation of JSR-223.                              *
*----------------------------------------------------------------------*
</pre>
This implementation requires a minimum of Java 1.4.
